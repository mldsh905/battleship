        Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy type guessing game. The locations of the fleets are concealed from each other. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. There are FOUR BATTLESHIPS on each side. Each battleship has 3 cells.
